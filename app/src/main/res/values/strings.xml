We\'re a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea
But as long as you are with me, there\'s no place I\'d rather be


I would wait forever, exalted in the scene
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We\'re different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It\'s a shot in the dark but I\'ll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can\'t shame me
When I am with you, there\'s no place I\'d rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I\'d rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I\'d rather be
N-n-n-no, no, no, no place I\'d rather be
Ooh ooh

We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace
Make it everlasting so nothing\'s incomplete
It\'s easy being with you, sacred simplicity
As long as we\'re together, there\'s no place I\'d rather be

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
Strolling so casually
We're different and the same, gave you another name
Switch up the batteries

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It\'s a shot in the dark but I\'ll make it
Know with all of your heart, you can\'t shame me

Hoo

Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah

From the second that I was born it seems I had a loaded gun\n
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved\n
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved\n
Am I out of luck?\n
Am I waiting to break?\n
When I keep saying that I\'m looking for a way to escape\n

    <string name="riverSong">I\'ve been a liar, been a thief\n
Been a lover, been a cheat\n
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\n
Well, little one, I don\'t want to admit to something\n
If all it\'s gonna cause is pain\n
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain\n
So let the river run\n
\n
\n
He\'s comin\' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack\n
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched\n
On his breath\'s Jack, he\'s a sex addict\n
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back\n
It\'s a chess match, she\'s on his back like a jet-pack\n
She\'s kept track of all his Internet chats\n
And guess who just happens to be movin\' on to the next\n
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks\n
\'Cause she loves danger, psychopath\n
And you don\'t fuck with no man\'s girl, even I know that\n
But she\'s devised some plan to stab him in the back\n
Knife in hand, says their relationship\'s hangin\' by a strand\n
So she\'s been on the web lately\n
Says maybe she\'ll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man\n
And I know she\'s using me to try to play him, I don\'t care\n
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said \'Bye Suzanne\'\n
After the first night, but tonight I am\n
\n
\n
I\'ve been a liar, been a thief\n
Been a lover, been a cheat\n
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\n
Well, little one, I don\'t want to admit to something\n
If all it\'s gonna cause is pain\n
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\n
So let the river run\n

One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand\n
It was \'come sunlight, scram,\' now we hug tight, and..\n
\n
He found out, now she feels deserted and used\n
\'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too\n
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we\'re through?\n
It\'s hard to find the words, I\'m aloof, nervous, and Sue\n
Don\'t want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth\n
Don\'t take it personal, I just can\'t say this in person to you\n
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners\n
Don\'t have to be reserved in a booth\n
I just feel like the person who I\'m turning into\'s\n
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it\'s church at the pew\n
And now that I got you I don\'t want you\n
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue\n
Why do I do this dirt that I do?\n
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech\n
Detergent and bleach is burnin\' the wound\n
\'Cause now with her in the womb\n
We can\'t bring her in this world, shoulda knew\n
To use protection \'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit\n
Fuck!\n
\n
I've been a liar, been a thief\n
Been a lover, been a cheat\n
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\n
Well, little one, I don\'t want to admit to something\n
If all it\'s gonna cause is pain\n
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain\n
So let the river run\n
\n
\n
My name\'s (ooh), my name\'s (ooh)\n
River (ooh), river run\n
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)\n
River (ooh), we'll let the river run\n
\n
Always the bridesmaid, never “The bride, hey!”\n
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway\n
And deceit was an enclave, I\'d be swerving in five lanes\n
Speeds at a high rate, like I\'m slidin\' on ice, maybe\n
That\'s why I may have came at you sideways\n
I can\'t keep my lies straight\n
But I made you terminate my baby\n
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled\n
What else can I say? It was fun for a while\n
Bet I really woulda loved your smile\n
Didn\'t really wanna abort, but fuck it\n
What\'s one more lie, to tell our unborn child?\n
\n\n

I\'ve been a liar, been a thief\n
Been a lover, been a cheat\n
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me\n
Well, little one (I\'m sorry)\n
